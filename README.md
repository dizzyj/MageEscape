# MageEscape
3rd person Zelda-like dungeon crawler
This is the original design document written for the class project.

[CSCI 321 - Game Design Document - Final Milestone - Group 4.pdf](https://github.com/dizzyj/MageEscape/files/12443727/CSCI.321.-.Game.Design.Document.-.Final.Milestone.-.Group.4.pdf)


The goal of this project is to build off of what we started in the class project, experiment with new techniques, and probably most importantly, fix bugs! For starters, due to time constraints certaint features that we planed didn't make it to the final product or made it in with an exceptional lack of polish. There are also some art related things that were not nearly a priority since this was a programming class.
